#+title: ReadMe
This is a small flake wrapper around a python script that adds missing "integrity" and "resolved" fields to a npm =package-lock.json= file.

You pass the path to =package-lock.json= as a command line argument to =npm-fixer=:
#+begin_src shell
npm-fixer ./path/to/package-lock.json
#+end_src
